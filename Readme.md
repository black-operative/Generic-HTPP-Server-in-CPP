## Code Organization

The Project is divided into 4 Parts :

- ### Header Files

- ### Source Files

- ### Build Files

- ### Static Website Files

## Class Structure

The class which is used to implement the Object Oriented Approach to the project has the following structure :

### Private Properties

```plaintext
- server_socket_fd : Socket file descriptor for server
- client_socket_fd : Socket file descriptor for client
- server_addr      : Server Address structure
- server_addr_len  : Server Address structure length
- response         : HTTP response structure
- file_reader      : Input File stream for file reading
- file_path        : Path to file
```

### Public Methods (Brief)

This sections briefly shows and explains the available Methods defined in the HTTP_Server class. The entire documentation is available in the [Extended Section](#public-methods-extended)

```plaintext
- init_server()        -> Initializes the basic configurations for server
- start_server()       -> Starts the server for active connections
- accept_client()      -> Accepts a client connection for providing services
- handle_client()      -> Handles an established client connection and provides services 
- send_response()      -> Sends an HTTP response with appropriate formatting
- send_file_res()      -> Sends the content of a file as an HTTP response
- not_found_res()      -> Returns HTTP Error 404 : Not Found Page to client
- illegal_method_res() -> Returns HTTP Error 405 : Method Not Allowed Page to client
- close_server()       -> Closes active connections and shuts down the server
```

## Custom Datatype

`HTTP_Response` is a structure containing the 3 required components of an HTTP response. It was created to simplify the process of creating a response object to send over the network.

```cpp
struct HTTP_Response {
    string header;
    string content_type;
    string body;
};
```

`HTTP_Response` is a C++ Structure that contains 3 string properties:
<pre>
<code>- header       : Defines <a href = "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Evolution_of_HTTP">HTTP Version</a> to be used and <a href = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status'>HTTP Response status code</a>
- content_type : Defines type of content being sent using HTTP response according to <a href = 'https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types'>Media / MIME Types</a>
- body         : Content to be sent using HTTP response
</code>
</pre>

## StdLib Functions / Data Structures used

### 1. socket()

```c

```

Creates a socket :

- **Domain   :** Communication domain type eg : AF_INET : IPV4 type Domain to use
- **Type     :** Socket type to use        eg : TCP / UDP / RAW etc
- **Protocol :** Protocol for socket ops   eg : 0 for default TCP/IP
- Returns fle descriptor for new socket created

### 2. sockaddr_in

```c
struct sockaddr_in {
    sin_family;
    sin_port;
    sin_addr;
}
```

- **sin_family :** Communications domain type eg : AF_INET : IPV4 type Domain to use
- **sin_port   :** Port number in Network byte order (BIG  ENDIAN i.e. First number stored first. Need to convert this to LITTLE ENDIAN i.e. Last number stored first, for CPU Execution)
- **sin_addr   :** IP Address for socket, changes depending on connection type (WiFi / Ethernet)
- ***Note*** : Data Structure used for server_addr Private property

### 3. bind()

```c
int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr *address, socklen_t address_len)
```

Allots network port to a socket for communication :

- **socket**      : Socket file descriptor value
- **address**   : Address of sockaddr struct type to interpret domain, protocol and address types (GPIO considerate measure)

```

- **socket      :** Socket file descriptor value
- **address     :** Address of sockaddr struct type from client with limited access
- **address_len :** Length of address struct passed before hand
- Returns file descriptor for accepted socket or -1 on failure

### 6. recv()

- **buffer :** Message buffer to store received message data into
- **buffer_len :** Message buffer length

```c
int sscanf(const char *target, const char *restrictor_format, char *destination1, char *destination2,......)
```

- **target :** Buffer to scan
- **restrictor_format :** Required format to scan and match required segments
- **destination1, destination2, destination3, ..... :** Series of buffers, where the results must be stored
- Returns number of items successfully matched from **buffer** and stored in **destination buffers**

### 8. snprintf()

Formats and stores a series of characters into a buffer, with an upper bound on the number of characters written:

```c
int snprintf(char *buffer, size_t buffer_size, const char *format, char *destination1, char *destination2,......)
```

- **buffer :** Destination Buffer where the formatted output will be stored.
- **buffer_size :** The maximum number of characters to write, including  null-terminator (`'\0'`).
- **format :** The format string specifying how to format the output (similar to `printf`).
- **destination1, destination2, destination3, ..... :** Series of buffers containing values to be formatted according to the format string.
- Returns number of characters written to buffer. If this value is less than `buffer_size` : successful write and if this value is more, then output was truncate.

### 9. send()

Sends a message to target socket in connected state :

```c
size_t send(int socket, const void buffer[], size_t buffer_len, int flags)
```

- **socket :** Socket file descriptor value
